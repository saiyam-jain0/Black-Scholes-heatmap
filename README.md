# Interactive Black-Scholes Option Pricing App

An interactive **Streamlit app** that provides a comprehensive tool for analyzing options pricing, profit & loss (P&L), and mispricing using the Black-Scholes model. The app integrates theoretical pricing with real market data to help users make informed decisions about options trading.

---

## Features

### 1. **Pricing Heatmaps**
- Visualize theoretical **call** and **put option prices** across a range of:
  - Spot Prices
  - Volatilities
- Understand how option values behave under different market conditions.

### 2. **P&L Analysis**
- Calculate the profit & loss (P&L) for options based on user-defined purchase prices.
- Heatmaps color-coded:
  - **Green**: Positive P&L.
  - **Red**: Negative P&L.

### 3. **Mispricing Visualization**
- Compare **theoretical Black-Scholes prices** with real market data:
  - **Blue**: Undervalued options (buying opportunities).
  - **Red**: Overvalued options (selling or avoid opportunities).
- Analyze mispricing across a range of spot prices and volatilities.

### 4. **Real Market Data Integration**
- Fetch live market data, including:
  - Spot Price
  - Strike Price
  - Implied Volatility
  - Option Prices
- Ticker selection powered by **Yahoo Finance**.
